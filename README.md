# pyDuino-interfacing
Practice project to read Arduino Serial Input using Python to hopefully use the data for something else.

##Current Implementation:
  Using 2 potentiometers, an Arduino outputs their voltage inputs from pins A0 and A1. This data is sent
  through Serial and read through Python. The received data is then used to control the X and Y values
  of a text label in a basic tkinter GUI window.
